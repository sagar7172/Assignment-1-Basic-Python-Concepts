**Python Basics Assignments**
This repository contains two basic Python programs demonstrating fundamental concepts:
1) Performing basic mathematical operations on user input.
2) Creating a personalized greeting message.

**Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations**
Problem Statement
This program takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the four basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), then displays the results.

**Features**

User input for two numbers.
Calculates sum, difference, product, and quotient.
Displays all results clearly.

**How to Run**

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
Save the code for this task (e.g., as Assignment1.py) in your local directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the program using the command: python Assignment1.py


Follow the prompts to enter the two numbers.

**Example Usage**
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.0

**Task 2: Personalized Greeting**
Problem Statement
This program takes a user's first name and last name as input, concatenates them into a full name, and then prints a personalized greeting message.
